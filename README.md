# Sequence to Sequence Model for Recipe Generation with and without attention

This repository contains the implementation of a deep neural model for generating recipes, both with and without attention mechanisms. Recipe generation is a fascinating natural language processing task with numerous practical applications, including chatbots, automated cooking assistants, and content generation.

# Overview 

Recipe generation is a challenging problem that combines language modeling and food domain knowledge. This project provides a deep neural model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant recipes. The repository offers two implementations: one without attention mechanisms and another with attention mechanisms, allowing you to explore and compare their performance.
